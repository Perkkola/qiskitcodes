-Import phase folding to iqm version
-Compare qiskit state preparation vs. phase folding gate counts when transpiling to Garnet with
different data set sizes

-Try to separate the regression weight pdeart as a separate circuit so that the whole data doesn't
have to be normalized after each iteration

-Implement the Arianne synth => Compare Qiskit state preparation with qiskit optimization vs. 
Arianne synth gate counts when transpiling to Garnet
